Boston Public Health Commission: BAHEC Scholar,1010 Massachusetts Ave,Boston,57,"Research shows that one in three Americans is a member of a racial or ethnic minority group , however, while they make up 30% of the population they only account for 12.3% of all physicians, 7% of dentists, 10% pharmacists, and 11% Nurses (http://www.thesullivanalliance.org/cue/about/faq.html#5).  BAHEC looks to close this gap by working with youth in Boston.   Each year nearly 250+ students apply to BAHEC which makes it a very competitive program. Students look forward to the opportunity to take courses in math in science to better prepare for the fall; participate in electives like dance, debate, gardening, and boot camp; shadow health professionals in various hospitals, community health centers, or public health agencies through field placements; participate in workshops to grow in professionalism and life skills.   In order to participate in BAHEC's Summer Enrichment Program, students need to be residents of Boston, high school students (rising 9th to rising 12th), must not be participating in summer school, must demonstrate levels of commitment and service in school and the community.
