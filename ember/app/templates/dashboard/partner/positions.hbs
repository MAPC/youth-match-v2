        The BCYF Youth Engagement and Employment Summer Jobs Program has allocated you a total

        In the list below, browse through applicants who have an interest in the position or 
        area of work you offer. Starting April 5th, you may review candidates and mark "Intend

        lottery.

        Please add your choices beginning April 5th and no later than April 28th. Your selections 
        create an official record of who you want to hire. <b>It is mandatory to select applicants 
        by April 28th to complete legal and HR requirements for employing youth.</b>
