Hello Community Partner,

Please see the follow information regarding selection your employees for the summer employment program:

Logging in to CBO Selection Tool:

Visit the following link: <%= @url %>

This is unique to you and your organization, so do not share it with untrusted parties. You may immediately begin to select applicants for your positions. 

Viewing and selecting your applicants:

You will see a list of applicants that are interested in your positions and also see a list of applicants that have selected an interest in the interest categories that your organization's positions fall under. You will be able to see the applicant contact information and reach out to the applicant to schedule an interview. If you intend to hire an applicant you should update their status in this tool to "hire" or if you do not wish to hire them to "do not hire".

Starting today, you may select and designate applicants as someone that you would like to hire. Your selections create an official record of who you want to hire. It is mandatory to select applicants by April 28th to complete legal and HR requirements for employing youth. You must also complete a mandatory form on your hiring practices here: <%=https://goo.gl/forms/k71ytvUcvZUxJJmW2%>
