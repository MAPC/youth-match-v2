This is unique to you and your organization, so do not share it with untrusted parties.

Viewing and selecting your applicants:

You will see a list of applicants that are interested in your positions and also see a list of applicants that have selected an interest in the interest categories that your organization's positions fall under. You will be able to see the applicant contact information and reach out to the applicant to schedule an interview. If you intend to hire an applicant you should update their status in this tool to "hire" or if you do not wish to hire them to "do not hire".

You will have until April 28th to select and designate applicants as someone that you would like to hire.

Please feel free to reach out to our team with any questions or if you notice any issues!
